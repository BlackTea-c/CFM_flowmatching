This notebook is a self-contained example showing how to train the novel Forest-Flow method to generate tabular data. The idea behind Forest-Flow is to learn Flow-Matching's vector field with XGBoost models instead of neural networks. The motivation is that it is known that Forests work currently better than neural networks on Tabular data tasks. This idea comes with some difficulties, for instance how to approximate Flow Matching's loss, and this notebook shows how to do it on a minimal example. The method, its training procedure and the experiments are described in [(Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09968).
